    <string name="help_content">Dear users!\n
Unfortunately I didn\'t release updates during last year as I don\'t have time to support the App.\n
Now I\'m releasing update to support latest Android versions.\n
Also I will try to update the list of gas stations.\n
If you have your own ideas regarding LPG Israel, you are more than welcome.\n
I will appreciate any help in developing the App.\n
        Parts that require support:\n
1. Android app\n
2. IPhone app\n
3. Web-client for data base (add/remove/edit gas stations info)\n
Answer any questions by e-mail.\n\n

        This app helps you to locate LPG refilling stations in Israel.\n
		                It allows you to select the station and get driving direction using your favorite
		                navigation application.\n\n
		                Usage:\n
		                On start it tries to find your position.\n
		                You can scroll around a map and click on points, to see information about station.\n
		                If you will click on station\'s information window, app will suggest you to choose navigation program.\n
		                And you can go!\n\n
		                Currently, there is no full data about all stations in Israel.\n
		                If you can update any information about refilling stations, please contact an author:\n
		                yakov.goldberg@gmail.com\n\n
		                Application is provided \"as is\".\n
		                The author is not responsible for any information inaccuracies in application 
		                and for any consequences resulting from usage of application.</string>
